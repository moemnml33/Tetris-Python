# Tetris game 

The following is the recreation of the classic Tetris game with python using pygame, and the following is the game walkthrough.

# About the commits, building the game step-by-step:

## First commit - the game's infrastructure:

In the first step, we're just laying the infrastructure of the game; creating an empty window in which the game will be run.

## Second commit - the base grid:

In the second step, we're creating the base grid; using a draw_grid function, we iterate over the x's and y's of the window (columns and rows) and draw our grid where each block is made of a grey square. With the parameters the function takes, the grid dynamically adapts to any changes we make to the window size, number of rows and columns, and the grid size.
